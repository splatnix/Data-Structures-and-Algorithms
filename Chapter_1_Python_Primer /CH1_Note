Chapter 1 Python Premier
- Python is a dynamically typed language, as ther eis no advance declaration associating an identifier with a particular data type.

- Conditional Expressions
	expr1 if condition else expr2

	instead of writing the following:
	if n >= 0:
		x = n
	else:
		x = -n
	above can be replaced by:
	x = n if n >= 0 else -n

- Comprehension Syntax
	result = [expression for value in iterable if condition]
	this is equivalent with:
	result = []
	for value in iterable:
		if condition:
			result.append(expression)

	As a concrete example, instead of:
	squares = []
	for k in range(1, n+1):
		squares.append(k*k)

	this can be replaced by:
	squares = [k*K for k in range (1, n+1)]

	[ k k for k in range(1, n+1) ] list comprehension
	{ k k for k in range(1, n+1) } set comprehension
	( k k for k in range(1, n+1) ) generator comprehension
	{ k : k k for k in range(1, n+1) } dictionary comprehension

- Simultaneous Assignments
	j, k = k, j
